# Plastic-Recycling-HotspotPlastic Recycling Hotspot Detection
This project analyzes plastic recycling data from Indian states to identify regions with low recycling performance — referred to as "hotspots". A simple logistic regression model is used to classify states based on their recycling rates.

📊 Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated for academic purposes.
It is inspired by the structure and features found in publicly available datasets on platforms like Kaggle.
Key features include:
Plastic Collected (Tons)
Grades 1 to 7 of Plastic
Recycling Rate (%)
Hotspot label (binary classification target)
🔍 Objective
Identify underperforming states based on recycling rate thresholds.
Train a basic machine learning model for hotspot classification.
Visualize recycling patterns and classification output.
⚙ Technologies Used
Python
pandas, numpy
scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
📈 Model
Logistic Regression: Chosen for binary classification due to simplicity and interpretability.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
📁 Files
skill4projectipynb.py: Main script containing data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
📌 Notes
The project is part of a student academic case study.
Dataset does not reflect real-world recycling performance and is for educational use only.
